# Pulse
This project aims to track the trend of word usage in [bioRxiv](https://www.biorxiv.org/) over time.
Search for a term and view a plot of it's occurance over time - essentially the pulse of this the term. Try it out [here](https://msbradshaw.github.io/Pulse/)!

## Want to contribute?
Here are some things that could be added
1. The API the front-end queries has support for searching only within a certain date range. The GUI does not currently make use of this feature, feel free to add it!
2. bioRxiv as a whole is becoming more populare, more papers are being published in it every month, to make Pulse's plots meaning full this overall growth needs to be controlled for, otherwise any given search term will look like it is becoming exponentially more populare.
